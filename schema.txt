}
Indexed on: 
    issueDate
    returnDate
    bookId & status
    memberId & status


Shortcomings: 
    List issues by date : we only get bookId and memberId. Need to read db again for book name, member name
    List books by name: we need to read db again for issues of the book, which returns us only memberId and no name
    List members by name: we need to read db again for issues made by person, which returns us only bookId and no name

Pros: 
    Storing issues in a seperate table and not in books because issues can be infinitely growing. We don't delete issues, we make status = returned 

Enhancements: 
    Store memberName, bookName in issues
    Store issues (status = issued) in book, member
